	        Eugenio: We have worked with our client and talked about their needs based on the insurance formats. Basically we have found out, what are the most time consuming which points of the writing a a format for the insurance companies who ask the doctors repetitive information. This key elements of repetition and time consuming task are perfect problems to be adressed using the engineering skills we have learned through out our studies. We are now ready to adress the coding part of our project now that we know the real necesities of our client.

	        David:
	        I worked with Eugenio to really narrow down the scope of the project. We have defined who would be our users and have a clear idea of what our solution does to solve the problem. We have talked with this users to find out what were their main necesities and which would be the correct perspective to address the insurance companies format problems. This where major questions that where holding us back in terms of development now we have adressed this key questions that will allow us to continue developing the main code for our project.

	        <h3>Explain the status of your project. Grade your project according to your effort and result </h3>
	        <p>
	            The current status is that we have mostly finished defining what are our solution's capabilities and how it will solve our users's problems
	            We are now in the step were we analyze what methodology we are going to use to code and basically create the site. An effort would be a 25% on effor 65% on the result due to the great progress on the information side but also the still not completed technical side.

	        <h3>Describe the main value of your team</h3>
	        <p>
	            The main value our team has are the key connections with our clients, making the search for key questions an easy and resourceful way of doing it. Making our research valuable, at the same time giving a solid base to the development of our project. Giving it extra value that anyone would appreciate.

	        <h3>Describe 4 characteristics of your user.</h3>
	        <p>
	            1- It's a highly educated user with medical knowledge
	            2- Time is invaluable for them so the less steps the better
	            3- Not very tech savvy
	            4- They use extremely high end equipment for medical prodecures but don't classify as computers.

			<h3>
			    Explain how your problem could be solved.
			</h3>
			<p>
			    the problem can be solved by providing a solution that streamlines the process to fill up forms, doing this using a computer instead of by hand makes it get done faster as well it having it as a legible format (not a the stereotypical doctor's handwriting).
