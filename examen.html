    Explaining to a 8 year old:
    Today doctors live in a economy where most of their clients have the necesity of a health insurace. A significant number of clients tend to use the health insurance. Forcing doctors to fill out long and tedious forms insurance companies demand the doctor in order to pay them. Doctors dont have the time to be filling this extensive forms and most of them tend to use the same information through out the form. Also insurance companies in Mexico tend to use similar forms asking similar questions. Making that a key factor for our problem and advantage for our solution.

    I had never worked with HTML and CSS before. While we had to learn almost all of it on our own. I have found HTLM to be really simple. I have found that focusing exactly on who is going to use it is very important as that can reduce or increase the scope of a project.
