<h4>Explain to a child what is the problem you are trying to solve. Use images or other multimedia resources.</h4>
    Explaining to a 8 year old:
    <br>
    Today doctors live in a economy where most of their clients have the necesity of a health insurace. A significant number of clients tend to use the health insurance. Forcing doctors to fill out long and tedious forms insurance companies demand the doctor in order to pay them. Doctors dont have the time to be filling this extensive forms and most of them tend to use the same information through out the form. Also insurance companies in Mexico tend to use similar forms asking similar questions. Making that a key factor for our problem and advantage for our solution.

    I had never worked with HTML and CSS before. While we had to learn almost all of it on our own. I have found HTML to be really simple. I have found that focusing exactly on who is going to use it is very important as that can reduce or increase the scope of a project.

    This first month was a really productive period of time. In which I learned how to use and implement cutting edge desing tools and code. I also learned a lot from my friend David which had more experience in the coding field!

<h2>Second Part</h2>
<h3>Explain who is the audience of your problem (project problem). </h3>
  <body>
  The audience for our problem are the doctors itself. However not all doctors fill out as more forms, than the ones who attend high or midddle class people who are able to afford a health insurance. So we are talking about doctors who tend to have their own office and are independent not woking for a government institution. 
  </body>
  <h3>Propose a no technological solution for your problem. Use CSS3 animations. </h3>
  <body>
  <div class="grow"> Probably a no tecnological solution for our problems would be that the doctor could go to a OFFICE STORE and take an insurance form filled the most with out filling the most tecnical parts of the form like name and date. Now the doctor could save sometime writting the forms.
