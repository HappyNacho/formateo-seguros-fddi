        Doctors don't have the time to be filling this extensive forms and most of them tend to use the same information through out the form. Which tend to be written by hand making the process even worse. Insurance companies in Mexico tend to use similar forms asking similar questions. Making that a key factor for our problem and advantage for our solution.

          Insurance forms are tedious and time consuming work which are limiting doctors all-round Mexico.
          We live in an era where the use if technology is implemented to solve our daily problems however doctors tend to be more focused about the old way. We believe doctors could save real time using our solution to the problem. The reason this is such a common problem is because insurance computers have not found a way to minimize the user's time investment when filling out the form. 
          The number one expert about the subject are the users themselves. In this case we asked a series of questions to a Doctor named. Dr. Eugenio Chavez Diaz which has been suffering from filling out insurance forms for years. Dr. Eugenio has Invested serious time and effort in each and single on one of this insurance forms he has ever filled out. However in our particular case not only was the doctor involved in the problem s their assistance tend to get involve to whenever they fill the form.
